DATA SUBMITTAL FORMS & POSTPROCESSING INFO
5th AIAA CFD Drag Prediction Workshop

DPW5 is collecting data using a Tecplot-readable format and template data forms are provided below.  Please complete as much of the form as possible, including the auxiliary data at the top of each form identifying the dataset.  One form is for detailed solution metrics, one form captures configuration force/moment data, two forms capture side-of-body and trailing edge separation data, and another form is used to submit the required sectional cuts.  A Tecplot macro is also provided that will automatically extract data on the surface at the required cut locations (see below for more details).  The macro should work on custom generated user grids, but that has not been tested. The rest of this page provides instructions on naming conventions for files to be submitted to DPW5 and instructions on use of the forms and macros.

The following Tecplot-readable Data Submittal Forms are required for submittal to DPW5:
	- Note that XXX in each DataForm should be replaced by the [Author-GridId-Turb-NumId] file identifier.
	- The SectionalCuts templates are the same for Case 1 & 2, but note the naming convention identifying the grid level or angle of attack.

    <[Author-GridId-Turb-NumId].SolverMetrics.dat>
    <[Author-GridId-Turb-NumId].ForceMoment.plt>
    <[Author-GridId-Turb-NumId].SOBSeparation.plt>
    <[Author-GridId-Turb-NumId].TESeparation.plt>
    <[Author-GridId-Turb-NumId].SectionalCuts_L?.plt>
	- Case 1: Fixed CL = 0.50, 4 Required Grid Levels = (2,3,4,5)
    <[Author-GridId-Turb-NumId].SectionalCuts_A?.??.plt>
	- Case 2: Grid Level 3,    7 Required Angles of Attack = (2.50,2.75,3.00,3.25,3.50,3.75,4.00)

The following Tecplot-readable Data Submittal Forms are optional, but encouraged, for submittal to DPW5:
    <[Author-GridId-Turb-NumId].SectionalCuts_L?.plt>
	- Case 1: Fixed CL = 0.50, 2 Optional Grid Levels = (1,6)
    <[Author-GridId-Turb-NumId].Turbulence.plt>
	- Case 3 Turbulence Model Verification
	- GridId = CommonStructured,CommonQuad,CommonTriangle,Custom
    <[Author-GridId-Turb-NumId].GridMetrics.plt>
	- Only Required For Custom Grids
	- The reported first boundary layer cell height should be that associated with (near) the quarter chord of the wing MAC

With the following file prepend guide/examples:
    Author = JonesG (<Last Name><First Name or Initial>)
    GridId = CommonMB, CommonOverset, CommonHex, CommonHybrid, CommonPrism, Custom, etc
      Turb = SA, SA-RC, SA-la, SST, SST-2003, Wilcox1998k-w, EARSMko2005, etc
                - Please follow the naming conventions established for each model at http://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/index.html
     NumId = Integer value identifying numerical specifications (except for turb model)
                - For first submission, NumId=1
                - For those changing flow solver input values/numerics (or even flow solvers) but the same Author, GridId, & Turb, increment NumId by 1 for each additional submission

One set of forms covers one complete set of runs on a given sequence of grids for all required and optional Cases. (If a participant runs more than one set of grids, more than one CFD code or methodology, or more than one turbulence model, then one set of forms would be required for each grouping.)

If participants analyzed additional alphas (for instance, to better define a force/moment curve), they are encouraged to include them in the data submittal. For example, if alpha = 3.60 deg was analyzed, the participant should add a line between alphas 3.50 deg and 3.75 deg.

Note that the SectionalCuts Data Form requires that data be extracted from the wing surface along specific constant y-plane cuts listed at the top of the SectionalCuts data form.  Some of these cuts correspond to locations for which experimental pressure tap data are available. See the diagram at:

    <http://aaac.larc.nasa.gov/tsab/cfdlarc/aiaa-dpw/Workshop4/forms/crm-wing-horiz-plan_v3.pdf>

for a graphic of how/where to take the cuts (DPW5 does not make use of the CRM horizontal tail).
 
Tecplot Macro File for Surface Data Extraction
For those participants with access to Tecplot, a macro file has been provided that can be used to extract data on the surface at the required cuts. Note that the SectionalCuts Data Form asks for data in the following order: X, Y, Z, CP, CF, CFX, CFY, CFZ (where CF, CFX, CFY, and CFZ should be given the value -999 if they are not being provided). Use these macros by performing the following steps for each solution which requires sectional cuts:

    Load Wing Surface Zones into Tecplot (i.e. Remove Fuselage Zones)
      a  Be sure that X, Y, and Z are in full scale inches
      b. The macro is for the half-plane geometry defined in the +Y direction, so if your geometry lies only in the -Y sector, flip your data using Data-CreateZone-Mirror-XZPlane
      c. If CP is not one of your solution variables, then use Tecplot to create it
    Assign LABEL variable in the macro file as the "XXX" identifier of the dataset
    Assign FILE variable in the macro file to the filename (& path) to write out sectional cut data
    Assign (X,Y,Z) variables in the macro file to the variable number in your dataset (typically 1,2,3)
    Assign CP variable to the variable number in your dataset (typically 4)
    Assign CF variable to the variable number in your dataset (if exists)
      a. If you do not set the variable number, a variable will be automatically created as CF=-999
    Assign CFX,CFY,CFZ variables to the variable number in your dataset (if exists)
      a. If you do not set the variable numbers, variables will be automatically created as CFX,CFY,CFZ=-999
    Run macro and verify output.  The macro will:
      a. Create and rename 16 new zones of extracted data at the required cuts
      c. Output the required variables for the new 16 zones to the file name set by the macro variable, FILE
    Copy zone data from output file into data form (DPW-V.DataForm_SectionalCuts.plt)

    <DPW-V.SectionalCutter.mcr>

(This macro was created with Tecplot 360, 2011 Release 2)
