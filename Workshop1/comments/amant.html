Technical comments on the results (to go with the slides)</h2>
Slide 2) : RANS solver, Spalart-Allmaras model, central scheme, implicit
LU-SGS method for the time marching, multigrid.
<p>Slide 4) : the colormaps are exactly the same ! On the Airbus France
grid, you can notice the separation at the trailing edge of the root of
the wing, which is a feature that many other participants have also captured.
<p>Slide 6) : there is an obvious correlation between the zones where the
skin friction is overpredicted and the regions where the grid is inclined
!
<p>Slide 7) : this is a front view of the leading edge of the wing at mid
span, for both pictures. The lack of orthogonality of the DPW provided
grid is clearly demonstrated.
<p>Slide 9) : the various physical components of drag are represented here.
They are computed and spatially distributed thanks to a dedicated post-processing
program.
<p>Slide 10) : the advantages brought by the far-field method are obvious.
It is more accurate (removal of the spurious drag contribution) and it
provides a very useful drag breakdown for the designers and the aerodynamic
database models (performance and handling qualities) as well.
<br>The relative importance of each component is associated to the low
Reynolds number and the low transonic Mach number : small value of wave
drag, huge values of viscous drag.
<br>Estimating to 10 drag counts the effect of the forced transition, compared
to a fully turbulent calculation, and assuming that the Spalart-Allmaras
model naturally triggers the transition at the leading edge of the wing
(which is indeed the case, a posteriori), you can notice that the far-field
approach yields results very close to those of the experiment (around 298-10=288
d.c.)

<h2>
My other feelings on the AIAA CFD Drag Prediction Workshop</h2>
The structured grid provided by the committe was obviously inadapted to
the topic. Calculating and analysing the drag force requires high quality
grids, especially with the Navier-Stokes modelization, which was not the
case with the proposed mesh. If the purpose was to highlight the sensitivity
of each code to the mesh quality, then I think it was irrelevant in the
framework of a DRAG Workshop. Either you test the robustness of a code,
or you test its accuracy (with a given parameter : here, the drag), but
you can't conciliate both at the same time, in my opinion. I mean that,
as well in an industrial context as in a research context, significant
efforts are undertaken to build appropriate grids when it deals with the
prediction of drag. This should be the basic priority for a Drag Worshop.
<br>If I remember well, among those who have used the the structured multiblock
grid, 4 participants out of 10 have not been able to provide satisfactory
results : this is the proof that a Workshop focused on the prediction of
drag MUST propose an adequate mesh, for the relevance and the validity
of its own conclusions.
<p>This was the negative aspect of my analysis. For the remainder, this
Drag Workshop was a great initiative since it has allowed worldwide searchers
and engineers to talk to each other, and to suggest various interpretations
on everybody's problems. Moreover, each participant seemed to have been
as honest as possible, without cheating or advertising too much on the
results. This state of mind was definitely one of the keys of the success
of the Workshop.
<br>In addition, such a meeting is a very efficient mean of building oneself
an overview of the state of the art in CFD, nowadays, either in industry
or in the research centers.
<p>I regret I can't provide the committee with my own grid, for obvious
reasons of confidentiality.
