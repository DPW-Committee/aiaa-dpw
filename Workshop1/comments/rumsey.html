<h1>
Narrative for viewgraphs</h1>

<h2>
Chris Rumsey</h2>

<p><br>Note:&nbsp; All slides not commented upon here; many of
<br>the word slides are self-explanatory.
<p>Issues Addressed
<br>&nbsp; - We ran mostly with the 1-to-1 grid, but also
<br>included some results using the overset grid.
<br>&nbsp; - Our primary focus was parametric studies.
<br>&nbsp; - We ran only M=0.75 cases.
<p>Grid Convergence
<br>&nbsp; - We performed a grid study using the given grid
<br>(with every other point removed, then again), but
<br>these coarser grids are probably too coarse to be in
<br>the asymptotic region for 2nd order convergence.
<br>&nbsp; - For purposes of workshop, it would have been
<br>best to have been given a family of grids, including
<br>one level finer than the current fine grid.
<p>Effect of Grid on Surface Pressures
<br>&nbsp; - Comparing 1-to-1 grid with overset grid results
<br>at alpha=0:&nbsp; 1-to-1 grid smears shock more than
<br>overset, especially near tip.&nbsp; Also, 1-to-1
<br>underpredicts LE suction CPs over much of wing.
<p>Grid Comparison
<br>&nbsp; - 1-to-1 has much coarser streamwise spacing
<br>(153 points around vs. 257 points around).
<br>&nbsp; - 1-to-1 also is of generally poorer quality:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - too coarse near LE.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - non-smooth interfaces.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - grid not orthogonal to wing surface!!
<p>Effect of Grid on Forces &amp; Moments (2 slides)
<br>&nbsp; - In spite of differences in CPs for 1-to-1 vs.
<br>overset, the forces and moments are fairly similar.
<br>Quantitative comparisons will be given in a later
<br>slide.
<p>Efect of Turbulence Model on Surface Pressures
<br>&nbsp; - All of the above was with SA (Spalart-Allmaras,
<br>Version Ia).
<br>&nbsp; - We now compare with SST (Menter's k-omega
<br>shear-stress transport) and EASM (explicit
<br>algebraic stress model, k-omega form).
<br>&nbsp; - Biggest differences at alpha=2.
<br>&nbsp; - There is separation at this condition, but in
<br>spite of this, the 3 models yield very similar
<br>results.&nbsp; But they're not identical - there are
<br>small differences, for example, near TE.
<p>Streamlines at Alpha=2 deg
<br>&nbsp; - If look at surface streamlines, we see small
<br>variations in the separation patterns.&nbsp; For
<br>example, SA predicts the largest separation region
<br>near TE, EASM the smallest.&nbsp; There is no way to
<br>know which is "better" in this case.
<p>Effect of Turbulence Model on Forces &amp; Moments
<br>(2 slides)
<br>&nbsp; - Very little difference noticeable,
<br>qualitatively.
<br>&nbsp; - Biggest difference occurs in friction drag.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - &lt; 20 count difference between models.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - SA has bigger friction drag than SST &amp;
EASM.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - 3 counts on upper wing surface,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 counts on lower wing surface,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12 counts on body.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - This difference may be smaller on finer
grids,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but because different models are
calibrated
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for flat plate and there are some
differences
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the calibration, there will
likely be
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; skin friction drag differences
even on
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fine grids.
<br>&nbsp; - Quantitative differences given later.
<p>Actual "Fully Turbulent" Transition Locations for
<br>Different Turbulence Models
<br>&nbsp; - "Fully turbulent" is a misnomer!
<br>&nbsp; - Contrary to popular belief, running a code
<br>"fully turbulent" does NOT mean the flow is actually
<br>fully turbulent.
<br>&nbsp; - Turbulence models transition on their own,
<br>a function of Re (unless you FORCE it with
<br>something akin to Spalart's forcing term).
<br>&nbsp; - For low-ish Re (1-10 million), the delay can
<br>be significant.
<br>&nbsp; - Here are upper surface transition locations
<br>for the 3 turbulence models at alpha=0.&nbsp; They are
<br>all fairly close to the LE, but they are not the
<br>same:&nbsp; SA is furthest forward, and EASM is furthest
<br>back.
<p>Effect of Forcing SA Transition to Match "Natural"
<br>Transition of EASM
<br>&nbsp; - We tested the transition effect by forcing
<br>SA to transition later, near the "natural"
<br>transition location of EASM.
<br>&nbsp; - The effect is very small.
<br>&nbsp; - (Note: we did NOT compare the effect of
<br>transition by setting to the experimental trip
<br>location - we only did a a study showing the
<br>effects due to differences in "natural"
<br>fully turbulent trip locations.)
<p>Effect of SA Version on Transition
<br>&nbsp; - Particular VERSION of SA model has an effect
<br>on variability, also!
<br>&nbsp; - Often, people claim to run a particular model
<br>(e.g., "SA"), but there are multiple versions
<br>and one is often not sure which version is being
<br>used.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - SA-Ia version is official version from
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recherche Aerospatial journal article.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - SA-fv3 version resulted from an e-mail
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from Spalart to code developers implementing
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his model early in the model's development.
<p>Effect of SA Version on Forces
<br>&nbsp; - In spite of big variations in transition
<br>location, effect on integrated forces and moments
<br>is relatively small.
<p>Summary of Effects at Alpha=0
<br>&nbsp; - Quantitative comparisons for all the
<br>parametric studies conducted are shown here,
<br>at the angle of attack where most of the runs
<br>were performed.
<p>Comments on EASM
<br>&nbsp; - Be cautioned that EASM is like many models:
<br>there are a lot of versions out there, all with
<br>the same or similar designation ("EASM").
<br>&nbsp; - Current version is in k-omega form.&yuml;&yuml;&yuml;
