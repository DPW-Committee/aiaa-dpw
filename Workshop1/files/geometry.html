<h1>
Notes on Preparation of Geometry</h1>

<hr>
<p>The geometry used for this workshop was prepared from data supplied
with the <a href="agard-ar-303.pdf">AGARD 303 report</a>. These data consist
of points defining the body at constant fuselage stations and the wing
at constant wing stations. The wing was defined in a wing coordinate system,
and was placed in the body system (according to Figure 1) with x and z
translations of 347.0 and -33.92 mm, respectively, and a dihedral of 4.8
degrees.
<p>Certain elements such as the wing tip, nose cap and tailcone closeout
were defined from text and figures in AGARD 303. Details of the windscreen
and the "flat" where the horizontal tail would mount were also not defined.
However, they were readily identifiable from the data. The fuselage surfaces
were fitted to the coordinates supplied using standard lofting techniques.
<p>The wing is originally defined with four stations, and is linearly lofted
between the stations. Elastic twist is then applied according to Figure
15. Approximately ten stations are used to distribute the twist, and the
lofting is linear between these twisted stations.
