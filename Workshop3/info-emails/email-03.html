<br>Subject: 	DPW Abstract update
<br>Date: 	January 30, 2006 9:30:47 AM EST

<p>A clarification on the abstracts.  We don't publish papers as part of the Workshop.  We publish the results and presentations on our web site.  The abstract is truly just an indication that you will present results at the Workshop.

 

<p>If you would like to publish a paper on your results, we recommend submitting a real abstract to an Applied Aerodynamics conference through the normal AIAA channels.

 

<p>Abstracts due February 10.

 


 

<p>The Workshop registration will again be handled by the AIAA as part of the conference registration.  There will be a price discount with the early bird deadline.  We will keep you updated.

 


 

<p>Sincerely,
<br>DPW 3 Organizing Committee
