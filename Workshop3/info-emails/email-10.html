We would like to know if there is anyone else planning to submit data.  Data received by start-of-business Monday, 15-May-2006, will be included in the statistical analysis.  Data received after Monday will be included in the post-workshop analysis to be presented at the ASM conference in Reno.

For any data received before the workshop, we will try to provide time for a presentation.  Presentations will not be allowed if data has not been received.

<b>Presentations</b>
<br><br> 
As in the past workshops, the presentation time will be between 15 and 20 minutes.  Common areas such as geometry will be discussed by the DPW Committee and should be excluded.
