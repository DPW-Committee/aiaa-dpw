<br>Subject: DPW Data form correction and clarification
<br><br>
An error was found in the DPW-III.DLR-F6.Case1DataForm.txt file.   
The alphas listed in the file did not match the Test Cases that were to be run.  The corrected file has been attached and will be posted on the web site.
<br><br>
For the wing alone Cp data form, we would like to clarify that we are asking for the fine grid results, not the "very fine" results.   
However, we would like to encourage everyone to submit CP/Cf results for all grids (in separate files).  Your work is helping to create a large database of results that will be available for further research.
<br><br>

Thanks for your participation.
<br>DPW-III Committee
