<p>Welcome again to the 3rd AIAA Drag Prediction Workshop.

<p>Unfortunately, we are having extra difficulty getting grids prepared and checked out for the workshop. The grids we have available have been posted and there should be more this coming week.

<p>The grids have not been checked out as thoroughly as we had hoped, but we want to make them available before the holidays.  If you discover any issues with any of the grids, please let us know as soon as possible.  The geometries are also available on the DPW web site.
