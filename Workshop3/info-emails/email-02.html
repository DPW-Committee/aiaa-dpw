<br>Subject: 	DPW 3 Updates
<br>Date: 	January 20, 2006 2:16:25 PM EST

<p>The abstracts are due today, but in light of the fact that we did not indicate how to submit them, we are extending the due date for two weeks.  The abstract is more for planning purposes than technical content, so it does not need to be extensive.

 

<p>Please email abstracts to <a href="mailto:dpw@cessna.textron.com">dpw@cessna.textron.com></a>

 

<p>Abstract extension - Feb 10
<br>Please identify the geometries for which you intend to present solutions (DLR-F6 and/or Wing Alone).

 


 

<p>The moment reference information on the DPW Wing Alone geometries was found to be in error.  It will be updated on the web site soon, but here it is:

 

<p>Relative to the wing root leading edge:
<br>x=154.245 mm, z=0.0 mm

 

<p>The W2 IGES geometry has the wing root leading edge at the origin, so the above is the correct moment reference.  For the W1 IGES geometry the moment reference translates to and z=2226.615 mm.

 

<p>Please note that some grids may move the geometry, so you should verify the wing root leading edge location (e.g. the Boeing DPW-W1 grid has been translated so the wing root leading edge is at the origin).

 


 

<p>Errors have been found in some of the grids.  Please check the ftp site for updates.

 


 

<p>Sincerely,
<BR>DPW 3 Committee
