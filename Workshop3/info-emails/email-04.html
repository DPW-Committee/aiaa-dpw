<br>Subject: 	DPW 3 Grid Updates
<br>Date: 	February 15, 2006 11:48:22 AM EST

<p>There are some new grids available on the ftp download site (<a href="https://dpw.larc.nasa.gov/DPW3">https://dpw.larc.nasa.gov/DPW3</a>).  There are additional structured grids in the Boeing multiblock family and additional unstructured node-based grids from NASA Langley.

 

<p>Please be sure to view the README file in the DPW3 directory for a history of the grid updates .

 


 

<p>We do apologize that the grids have not been evaluated as well as they have in the past.  Please let us know if you discover any issues with any of the grids.

 

<p>There are currently unresolved issues with the following grids:

 
<br>
<br>hex_Embraer - dpw3_DLRF6_fairingoff_24000kcells.tar.gz - crossed cells

 

<br>multiblock_icem_cfd/w2 grids - surface spacing

 

<br>multiblock_icem_cfd/w1 medium grid - missing blocks

 


 

<p>I also apologize that I have not been sending out timely notifications on the grid updates.  I will try to do better in the future.

 

<p>Sincerely,

 

<p>Tom Zickuhr
