<h2> 3rd AIAA CFD Drag Prediction Workshop Gridding Guidelines </h2>

</center>



<ol>

<li> Grid Convergence Cases



<ol class="withalpha">

<li> DLR F6 FX2B  Wing-Body with wing-body fairing - Required 3 grid levels

<li> DLR F6 Wing-Body Configuration - Medium grid required, coarse and fine grids optional 

<li> DPW-W1 Baseline Wing Alone - Required 4 grid levels

<li> DPW-W2 Wing Alone - Required 4 grid levels

</ol>



<li> Grid Guidelines



<ol class="withalpha">

<li> Spacing normal to all viscous walls 



<ol class="withroman">

<li>	dy = 0.00060 mm (Y+ <  1.0) on the coarsest mesh

<li>	dy = 0.00040 mm (Y+ < 2/3) on the intermediate mesh

<li>	dy = 0.00027 mm (Y+ < 4/9) on the fine mesh

<li>	dy = 0.00018 mm (Y+ < 8/27) on the extra-fine mesh (DPW-

W1 and DWP-W2 Wing Alone)

</ol>

<li>	Recommended practice: generate grids with 2 cell layers of 

constant spacing normal to viscous walls

<li>	Total grid size to grow ~3X between each grid level for grid 

convergence cases

<li>	For structured meshes, this growth is ~1.5X in each coordinate 

direction (Required for Wing Alone cases; Recommended for DLR 

F6 and DLR F6 FX2B cases)

<li>	Grid convergence cases must maintain the same grid family 

between grid levels, i.e. maintain the same stretching factors, same 

topology, etc.

<li>	Growth rate of cell sizes should be < 1.25.

<li>	Farfield located at ~100 CREFs for all grid levels.

<li>	For the Intermediate Baseline Grids:



<ol class="withroman">

<li>	Chordwise spacing at wing leading edge (LE) and trailing 

edge (TE) to be ~0.1% local chord.

<li>	Wing Spanwise spacing at root ~0.1% semispan.

<li>	Wing Spanwise spacing at tip  ~0.1% semispan.

<li>	Cell size near fuselage nose and after-body ~2.0% CREF.

</ol>



<li>	For the Coarse and Fine Baseline Grids, the above values should 

be scaled accordingly.

<li>	Wing Trailing Edge Base 



<ol class="withroman">

<li>	Minimum of 8 cells across TE base for the coarsest mesh

<li>	Minimum of 12 cells across TE base for the medium mesh

<li>	Minimum of 16 cells across TE base for the fine mesh

<li>	Minimum of 24 cells across TE base for the extra-fine mesh

</ol>



<li>	Size the intermediate mesh to be sufficient for industry drag 

prediction.

<li>	Be multi-grid friendly

<li>	DLR F6 FX2B:    Coarse ~2.7M nodes, Intermediate ~8.0M nodes, 

Fine ~24.0M nodes for structured grids. For unstructured grids 

designed for vertex based solvers, the spacings refer to inter-nodal 

spacings and the resulting grid sizes are expected to be similar to 

the structured grid sizes above. For unstructured grids for cell-

centered solvers, the spacings refer to spacings between cell 

centers (or surface face centers), which corresponds approximately 

to a factor of 2 reduction in the overall number of surface points 

compared to the nodal solver case, for a triangular surface grid (this 

is based on triangle centroid separation distance of 2/3h). For 

tetrahedral cell-centered-solver meshes, the total number of grid 

points will be approximately 1/3 of the numbers listed above.
