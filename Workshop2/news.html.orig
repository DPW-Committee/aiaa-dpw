Early results indicate areas of separation on the model that are having 
significant effects on the solution. The wing-body junction and the 
side of the pylon seem to be the two areas with the largest impact. 
Some of the results are showing better matches of Cp or drag (not 
necessarily together) depending on whether alpha or CL is specified or 
depending on which differencing scheme is used. </P>
<P>
This looks like it will be a good area to address in your 
presentations, and to make some attempt to quantify a part of this, we 
would also like you to report on the size of the wing-body separation 
bubble. For the constant CL runs (Case #1, all grids), we would like 
you to report the forward and spanwise extent of the separation in 
terms of the Fuselage Station and Butt Line in millimeters. This will 
be added to the data submittal form. </P>
<P>
We would also like to clarify the moment reference location so that we can 
have consistent data submitted to the workshop. </P>

Xref = 157.9 mm (504.9 mm aft of the nose) </P>

Yref = 0 mm </P>

Zref = -33.92 mm </P>

The Data Submittal date is May 16, but we should be able to make accomodations 
for late submittals. Please let us know if you will need to submit late.</P>
