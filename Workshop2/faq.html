<h2>
Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<hr>
<p>Q.
<br>What aspect ratio should we use.
<p>A.
<br>Using b^2/S, the model aspect ratio is 9.436.
<br>
<hr>
<p>Q.
<br>I need to know the coordinates of the nacelle centerline to be able
to define a cutting&nbsp; plane for nacelle pressure extraction.
<p>A.
<br>The following two points on the nacelle centerline were picked in CATIA.
<p>Point 1: x: -8.73756&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; y: -205.39937&nbsp;&nbsp;
z: -28.54676
<br>Point 2: x: 203.95542&nbsp;&nbsp; y: -209.07073&nbsp;&nbsp; z: -35.98394
<br>
<hr>
<p>Q.
<br>What information/results are we to provide to the DPW by May 16?
<p>A.
<br>The requested data set will be similar to the first workshop.&nbsp;
The form is posted on the home page.
<br>
<hr>
<p>Q.
<br>I downloaded the file DPW_pressure_WBPN_183 from the web site. Unlike
the alpha sweep Forces files, the pressure file is strewn with ^M carriage
returns all over the place. Can anything be done to clean up this file?
<p>A.
<br>The files have been corrected.
<br>
<hr>
<p>Q.
<br>Where are the pylon pressure taps located?
<p>A.
<br>A sketch of nacelle and pylon pressure tap locations has been posted
<br>under wind tunnel data and may clarify pressure tap locations.
<br>
<hr>
<p>Q.
<br>Where can internal nacelle drag data be found?
<p>A.
<br>Internal drag data for a single nacelle has been posted under wind
tunnel data.
<br>
<hr>
<p>Q.
<br>In the file"Information about the wind tunnel test and model" the most
<br>inboard row of wing pressure taps is said to be located at y/b=0.15
<br>but in the data files, the location is given as y/b=0.185.
<p>A.
<br>The true location is y/b=0.15, recently verified by direct inspection
of the
<br>wind tunnel model. This is the result of an old typographical error,
with the
<br>incorrect number finding its way into past publications.
<p>The surface pressure data files on the website have been corrected.
<br>
<hr>
<p>Q.
<br>In the file "Information about the wind tunnel test and model" the
midwing
<br>pressure taps are said to be located at y/b=0.411, while in data files
DPW_pressure_WBNP_182
<br>and DPW_pressure_WBNP_183, the location is given as y/b=0.441.
<p>A.
<br>The true location is y/b=0.411. Another typographical error that has
been
<br>corrected in the website data files.
