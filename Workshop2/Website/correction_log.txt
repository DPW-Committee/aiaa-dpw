              Log of Corrections to DPW2 Data Website

1/13/2003

- An error in the identifier of wing section 1 in the F6 wind tunnel 
  data (pressure) has been corrected.  The spanwise position of the 
  pressure taps of wing section 1 is y /b: 0.15 instead of 0.185. So 
  the zone-name of section 1 of the files DPW_pressure_WB_270(273,275) 
  and DPW_pressure_WBPN_182(183,184) have to be changed from 
  ZONE T="wing section 1 y/b 0.185" to ZONE T="wing section 1 y/b 0.15". 

- Correction to DPW_pressure_WBPN_182 and DPW_pressure_WBPN_183
  In the section 5 (ZONE 5), the position versus the wing span y/b is 
  0.411 (in line ZONE ...), and not 0.441.

- Data for pressure at CL: 0.6 is now added to the website.

- JPG figure is included to clarify position of the pressure taps on the 
  nacelle and pylon.

1/15/2003
- added GRIDS and FAQ links to main DPW2 workshop page
- added internal nacelle drag coefficients and surface detail image

2/14/2003
- An error in the span location of wing section 1 in the F6 wind tunnel
  data (pressure) has been corrected.  The spanwise position of the
  pressure taps of wing section 1 is y=0.08785 instead of 0.10872

- Added photo of the F6 wind tunnel model
